## Defining Projects

Mentors and admins can define projects in markdown using the following structure and save it in the collections/_projects folder with a relevant filename:

```
---
name: "Write Project Name Here"
desc: "Write a one line Description of Project here."
requirements:
 - "The applicant has to fulfill this to get started."
difficulty: "low|medium|high"
size: "175 hours|350 hours"
issues:
 - "https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/####"
mentors:
 - sils
 - sims1253
initiatives:
 - GSoC
tags:
 - Plugins
 - CI
collaborating_projects:
 - "Add umbrella and sub-orgs here"
---

This space is for the main description. Use it wisely.

```

## Local testing

### Simple way

* push your file to github and look it up there. github renders your markdown file and should display a table above the main text. If that's the case it is valid, most probably :)

### Advanced way

* install ruby and gem as prerequisites
* install jekyll: ```sudo gem install jekyll bundler```
* checkout projects software ```git checkout https://github.com/freifunk/projects```
* delete contents of the original software
  * ```rm projects/_projects```
  * ```rm projects/_faq```
* copy our own contents
 Â * ```cp collections/_projects projects/_projects```
  * ```cp collections/_faq projects/_faq```
* run jekyll and bundler
  * ```cd projects```
  * ```bundle install```
  * ```bundle exec jekyll serve```

## Deployment in Production

* install ansible
* run ```ansible-playbook deploy_coala-projects.yml -i path-to-your-inventory --limit "the server to deploy to" --extra-vars "install_user=your-install-user install_path=/path/to/install"```
