question: "How do I connect with the communities?"
order: 7
---

There are many ways to introduce yourself to the communities. A lot of communities do have meetings regularly. Everyone is invited to join those meetings.

Over the year there are a lot of opportunities to meet community members at several events. We host the Wireless Community Weekend in May in Germany, there's the Battlemesh every year in another place in Europe. Communities represent themselves at events like FOSDEM in Brussels, the Chaos Communication Congress, or the Chaos Communication Camp.

When your proposal gets accepted you'll also get a blog account to show your project's progress and results.
