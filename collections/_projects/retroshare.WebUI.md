Retroshare already has a Web Interface, which communicates to the headless retroshare-service through the built-in Json API, and that is the result of work from previous GSoC sessions.
This interface needs to be completed, which may still need quite a lot of work. See https://github.com/retroshare/RSNewWebUI/.

#### Milestones

Missing components are the following:

* implement panels for software configuration
* implement panels for configuring and visualizing own shared files 
* implement the display of forums

##### PREPARATION/BONDING

* get familiar with the Retroshare network
* understand how GXS works. A white paper is available here: https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01617423
* discuss possible options with the developers
* we only recruit applicants who made relevants pull requests to the project before the selection period begins. Ask the devs (retroshare.project@gmail.com) for the key to the dev Tor node, and meet them in the dev forum/chat *before* the project application period starts.
