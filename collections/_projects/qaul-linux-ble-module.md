# qaul BLE Module for Linux with BlueR

**Create a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) module in rust which compatible to the two existing modules for Android & iOS.**

Create a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) module in rust which compatible to the two existing modules for Android & iOS.

Existing android BLE module:
<https://github.com/qaul/qaul.net/tree/main/android/blemodule>

It shall do the following things:

* Listen for BLE advertisements
  * detect neighbour nodes
* Send BLE advertisement messages in regular intervals.
* send arbitrary binary data to nodes nearby.
* receive arbitrary binary data from nodes nearby.

The module is independent and will communicate via protobuf to the controlling backend library libqaul.

`BlueR` is the official Bluetooth low energy repository for rust.
<https://github.com/bluez/bluer>

Prototypes with partial functionality already exist.

## About qaul

[qaul](https://qaul.net) is an Internet independent wireless mesh communication app. To communicate P2P directly from device to device and mesh all interconnected devices together.
qaul.net interconnects Android, iOS, Linux, MacOS & Windows devices via LAN, Bluetooth and Internet overlay connections.

qaul is written in rust, uses rust-libp2p internally and has a cross platform flutter GUI.

## Resources

* [qaul github repository](https://github.com/qaul/qaul.net)
* [BlueR Rust BLE library](https://github.com/bluez/bluer)

## Milestones

* setup rust protobuf communication with libqaul
* create advertising (prototype exists)
* create scanning (prototype exists)
* create GATT service for ID exchange
* send message
* receive message
