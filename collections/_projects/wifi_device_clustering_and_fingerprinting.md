The goal is to create an environment that allows to collect rate control and client capabilities to optimize transmission rate control for client devices. To this end, the project will leverage an interface provided by the supraconex [1] project to collect transmission rate statistics from OpenWrt-based [2] devices. Moreover, the system should also allow to leverage fingerprinting mechanisms based on the client capabilities such as WiFi taxonomy [3].

Within the project, both approaches are combined to perform a client-based clustering of WiFi devices to create an understanding whether used rates etc. might correlate between different classes of devices. This should allow to further optimize transmission rate algorithms in the presence of handovers etc. Accordingly, a measurement environment needs to be proposed that allows to anonymously collect statistics from different home networks.
