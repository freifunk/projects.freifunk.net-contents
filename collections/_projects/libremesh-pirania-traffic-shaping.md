Pirania captive portal is already in production in some community networks running LibreMesh on their routers.
The usage of Pirania helps the community to pay the bill from the internet service provider.
But LibreMesh project also tries to open the access to the local and remote digital resources to everyone, and for this reason the availability of a guest access would be recommended.
This will require that the presence of a connected guest client does not slow down the connection of the owner of the gateway or of who actually paid for having a Pirania voucher.
In order to achieve this, the data packets needs to have different priorities depending on the originating client, disregard the mesh node (access point) this client is connected to.
The problem is absolutely non-trivial, and the technical tools needed will be at least Traffic Control, Smart Queue Management, and iptables.
